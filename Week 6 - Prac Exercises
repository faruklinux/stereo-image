Task 0
Introduction to camera projection --> matrices 
Introduction to feature detection

Task 1
Match features between images (Harris) vs using SIFT matching 

Task 2
Find the position of a car in an image using feature detection/matching + check for outliers (RANSAC) 

Task 3 
Use stereo correspondence (stereo vision) to find the features in other camera and estimate the distance to the vehicle(s) 

Task 4 
Example of NN detection YOLO. To find distance to devehicle would need a depth map of scene (available CV algorithm?)
